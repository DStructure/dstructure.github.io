                    <p>Look Linear search break it down so we get line & ar that means we are
                    going to search a line and get the desired output.Linear Search means search in a 
                    line and finding out the match.
                    This topic is pretty much similer with roll call in class.When our Sir calls our roll that is maintain a serial because the rolls are set there serially
                    But in real life we got the data that is not sorted.So the rule is get the data is it what I am searching for? If it is that then execute.
                    <br><br>
                    Think more simply. Assume that you are going to search your girl friend from 100 girls row.and you can only see one girl.So you are going check one after one and find your's.
                    As soon as you get your girlfriend you are not going to search anymore.You will grt her and go for a date.
                    So what we see ? when you get what you are searching that time you execute your searching.
                    <br>
                    If your girl friend was not there you will search till the last one.When you know that your friend is not 
                    there you are going search her in other place.
                    But someguys will do something else.
                    Just kidding !!!
